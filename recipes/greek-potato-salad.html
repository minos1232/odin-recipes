    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

            <li>24 ounces unpeeled bite-sized potatoes</li>
            <li>1 stalk celery, diagonally sliced</li>
            <li>1/2 cup pitted and sliced Kalamata olives</li>
            <li>1/2 cup diced red onions</li>
            <li>1/3 cup roughly chopped fresh dill</li>
            <li>1 (2 ounce) jar diced pimento, drained</li>
            <li>1/2 cup olive oil</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons freshly-squeezed lemon juice</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1/2 cup roughly crumbled feta cheese, or to taste</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><p>Place potatoes in a large pot, and cover with salted water by about an inch. Bring water to a boil, and simmer just until fork tender, 15 to 20 minutes, depending on potato size.</p></li>
            <li><p>Drain potatoes, cool just slightly, cut in half, and transfer to a large bowl. Add celery, olives, red onions, dill, and pimento, and stir until incorporated.</p></li>
            <li><p>Whisk olive oil, lemon juice, oregano, salt, and pepper together in a small bowl, and drizzle over the warm potato salad. Sprinkle feta on top, and gently toss. Serve warm, at room temperature, or chilled.</p></li>
